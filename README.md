# Matakuw

A project using machine learning and flutter to detect cataracts

## Getting Started

Start by cloning the application from github.

cd into the directory you want to clone it into

```terminal
cd /your-path
```

Now cd into the cloned directory and run:

```terminal
flutter pub get
```

To keep the code base up to date run:

```terminal
git fetch --all

git pull --rebase origin main
```

That will get all the dependencies you need to get the app up and running

Now run the app by either clicking the green run button on android studio or run:
```terminal
flutter run
```
Make sure you have an emulator or a USB connected device with USB debugging on.
